8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -c <source-file>       
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o broken main.c
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	there are 2 undefined references to getArea and getCircumference,
	because main.c includes "circle.h", not "circle.c" by default
	and the getArea function in circle.c was defined as getAreas
